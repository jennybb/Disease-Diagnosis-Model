# Disease-Diagnosis-Model

This project is going to use multiple machine learning algorithms, including <b>naive Bayes classifier</b>, <b>K Nearest Neighbor</b>, <b>Support Vector Machine</b> ( with both linear and n on-linear kernel functions), <b>Random Forest</b> and <b>Gradient Boosting Classifier</b>, <b>logistic regression</b>, <b>multiple artificial neural networks</b> and <b>deep learning models</b> with different architectures to build disease diagnosis models. It is a binary classification problem to predict whether or not a patient has a certain unspecified disease.

And I will discuss wherever applicable that the above machine learning classification algorithms could predict the
probability of the target class label, generate Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve and calculate Area Under Curve (AUC) metric for the identified best performing models.
